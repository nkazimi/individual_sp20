    "1)one important way to improve the health inspection of the local restaurant in the city is to be able to make a clear safety inspection for the employers that are working there and make food for people. The safety health inspection can help to reduce the risk of anything that can containment with bacteria and toxic chemical, and make food borne illnesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Another important fact for not causing the food borne illnesses is the health investors make sure to check the foods temperature, for instance, the food that supposed to be in the freezer, make sure to keep them in ice while you using them in order to not bacteria grow on them and not put the people healths in danger. inspectors might pay attention to the thermometer in the fridge and freezer to make sure they work properly.\n",
    "    prior to dat analysis, I dug deep into what is the best way to improve the health inspection of the local restuarant in the city, the idea of safety inspection for the employers and the restuarnt would be a great way to s make the restuarant to be take care of the safety more and healthy meal for customers. \n",
    "    the minumum of safty inspection per year is two times a year. I would suggest more and often to be happen for safty part. my prior work gave me a good understanding of the project topic to take care of the restuarnt safty for better serve and help customers to have healthy meal. \n",

Also I believe for checking the restaurant inspection, an unscheduled inspection check can be a great fear for the owner to keep the place safe and healthy. also cleaning tables in restaurants can impact a lot of safety for customers who like to sit and enjoy their meal at the restaurant."

My goal is to keep restaurants grade pass 95 to keep the restaurant open and safe for customers. Also, this dataset contains Environmental health inspection for Restaurant and markets that have food in Los Angeles. the Environmental health of this city is responsible for inspections and enforcement activities for all other unincorporated areas which is about 85 to 88 cities in the county. \n",

My goal to clean all the data come from bias which it seems was non because all the data was base of record. \n"

Also, be able to provide better food for customers. another thing that when a place is clean to eat many people are going to have great feedback about in yelp and will recommed the place to other friends and family. \n",
    "    therefore, the  health inspectors have great responsible to check for the places and make sure that the place is good serve food to people. Also, workers nd vendors are work cleaner when they know there will be inspctor come soon. I expected that inspectors are 2 to 3 times per year, however, I notice it just happen once a year. "
